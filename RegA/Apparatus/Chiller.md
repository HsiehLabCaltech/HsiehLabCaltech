## Temperature instability Dec. 2021
We have a Solid State Recirculating Chiller T225P from ThermoTek. Recently, the chiller started failing to stabilize at the set temperature. The temperature indicator shows a reading fluctuating between 18C and 20C, when the set is 19C, while the fluctuation range was as good as +-0.1C. There are probably something wrong. 

I was wondering if we should send it back to the company for a professional evaluation, or if I can do a quick self-evaluation. Besides, I would like to request a quote for both the evaluation and repair, and a quote for a new chiller. 

Some information about the chiller:
The model #:T255P 3CR
Serial #: A48358

Hello Chen,

Thanks for your email.  First I need to tell you that the T255P chiller was retired 5+ years ago and can no longer be repaired or serviced.  However from your description do not believe there is anything really wrong with your chiller.  I would recommend you try two things to improve the stability.

 

Try reducing the set temperature by a few degrees.
If the ambient temperature is very close to the set temperature, sometimes the chiller can have a hard time stabilizing
It is possible there is contamination around the water fittings which can cause behavior like this.  Cleaning the fittings and flushing the chiller using the instructions below should fix this. 
 

Regarding your temperature fluctuation, this type of instability is a symptom that is common and can occur over time, but rarely directly a fault of the chiller.  More likely what is happening is that the instability is caused by biological growth and particulate contamination collecting at the supply-side (top) quick disconnect fitting on the chiller.  This restriction is causing low fluid flow through the fittings and hoses to the chiller which causes the display instability.

 

We recommend you flush the chiller with several liters of distilled water, then remove and clean (or replace) both water fittings on the chiller, reassemble and retest.  Cleaning or replacing the water fittings is the critical step.

 

The connectors on the side of the unit that your system plugs into, are removable.  If you use a wrench or pliers, they will unscrew from a fitting inside the chiller.  Remove it, over a sink or bucket, as the water will pour out.  Clean the inside of that connector and pour a liter or so of water into the reservoir to flush anymore material out.  When you re-insert the connector, use Teflon tape, or clear silicone sealant on the threads to prevent leaks.  The flow should return to normal and the temp should stabilize again.

 

 

Sincerely,

David
